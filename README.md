# Introduction
I've been wanting to apply my programming skills and build a tool that would be practical for people.  The project I decided on was developing a tool that would help users finding the best skin care product based on the user's skin type.  This project was inspired by a close friend of mine who was completely new to skin care.  She asked me about my skin care routine.  At that moment, I thought to myself why not make a tool that would help users choosing the best product?  

Skin-Care is a very exciting project for me because I am passionate about skin care.  Now I can combine two things I am passionate about and find a solution that would help myself and others! 

Here is the [demo](https://skin-care-gd.herokuapp.com/) I deployed onto Heroku.

Tools: Python-Flask, PostgreSQL, AWS-RDS, HTML5, CSS, Matplotlib
